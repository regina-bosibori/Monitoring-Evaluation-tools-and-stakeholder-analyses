# Monitoring-Evaluation-tools-and-stakeholder-analyses 
I have designed M&E tools for SAHI SOMALIA Program concept note 
It includes a logical framework consisting indicators, their means of verification and the risks/assumptions made
There's also a designed data collection matrix and performed stakeholder analysis for the project 
I have created this for personal practice in building my M&E skills and shared it to the public for people with an M&E interest in learning and application.
Your positive contributions are most welcome:) Lets Grow Together!
